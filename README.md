# ENGAGE-BAKERY
I created the popular Engage Bakery Homepage and I did not use gridbox nor flexbox . Instead I used inline-block and float . I also made sure the website Is responsive WITHOUT using any media queries by utilizing percentages and vw for fonts.
This project was done by myself alone as an assignment for the fullstack diploma i am currently enrolled in. It is one of the early aassignments, more advanced ones will be assigned to me and i will be posting it in future repos isa.
You can view this project via the link in the pages section(setting -> pages).
